NeoPong is a basic browser based video game inspired by the classic game Pong. The player controls a "paddle" and attempts to score goals against their opponent by bouncing the ball off the paddle.

Specifically it has the following features
* Main menu where the player can provide a name and start the round
* Start menu includes an input to set the winning score for the round
* Single player mode where the player can play versus an AI
* The map is a square containing two rectangular paddles and one square ball
* The player's paddle is on the left side and can move in a linear direction up and down using the W and S keys
* The AI's paddle is on the right side and has the same movement restrictions as the player's paddle, however the AI will control the paddle to try and hit the ball back
* There is a score board on the bottom of the page that counts the number of goals for the player and their AI opponent
* When a goal is scored, play a brief celebratory animation (e.g., flash, screen shake, and/or particle burst)
* Before the ball spawns at the start of the round and after each goal, display a centered countdown animation: "3... 2... 1... START!"
* The two paddles should have contrasting colors to clearly distinguish the player and the AI
* After a goal is scored, both paddles reset to the middle before the countdown and next serve
* The default winning score should be 3
* The ball displays a short trailing animation whose color reflects the last hitter (player vs AI)

## Implementation details
* The game must be compatible with popular browsers including Google Chrome
* You are free to use any free frameworks or programing languages to accomplish the task
